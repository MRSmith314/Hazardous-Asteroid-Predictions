Note: It is important that if you are going to use this code, all files
are placed in a directory that matches this repository, for the better functionality of it.
Otherwise you would have to adjust the paths on the files, accordingly.

This repository consists of a team project where we explore the predictability of asteroid impacts using machine learning models.
